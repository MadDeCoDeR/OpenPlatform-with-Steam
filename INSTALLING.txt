INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

Dynamic:
Extract the desired .dll/.so to a directory your game can read and load files from. 
In case you want to use additional libraries (eg. steam_api.dll) extract it to a directory
your game can load libraries from (it might be different from the previous directory.)

Static:
Extract the desired .dll/.so to a directory your game can load libraries from (usually the same folder where the executable is).
The same applies to additional libraries (eg. steam_api.dll)
